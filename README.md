Welcome to the Statistical Analysis Program! This program is designed to perform statistical analysis on a dataset by calculating the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

## Features

- Reads data from a file.
- Calculates the Linear Regression Line.
- Calculates the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
- Prints results with specified decimal precision.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```
go run your-program.go data.txt
Replace your-program.go with the actual name of your Go program and data.txt with the path to your dataset file.

After reading the file, the program will print the results in the following format:

Linear Regression Line: y = <value>x + <value>
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: <value>
The values in between the single angle quotation marks (< >) are decimal numbers. The Linear Regression Line values have 6 decimal places, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient value has 10 decimal places.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistical-analysis-program.git
cd statistical-analysis-program
Run the program:

go run your-program.go data.txt
